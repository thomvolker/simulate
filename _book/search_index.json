[["univ.html", "Chapter 2 Univariate data", " Chapter 2 Univariate data In general, generating univariate data is relatively straightforward. R is full of functions that allow to generate data given a prespecified distribution, of which only the parameters have to be determined. As one of the simplest examples, consider the variable \\(X\\), which follows a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) \\[ X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2), \\] such that \\[ f(X) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp \\Bigg{\\{} - {\\frac{(X-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}} \\Bigg{\\}}. \\] In R, one can easily sample from this distribution, using the rnorm function that is in-built, with parameters n, mean and sd. In practice, if we want to generate \\(n = 1000\\) values from a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu = 0\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sqrt{\\sigma^2} = \\sigma = 1\\). Hence, \\(X\\) is said to follow a standard normal distribution. set.seed(42) n &lt;- 1000 mean &lt;- 0 sd &lt;- 1 X &lt;- rnorm(n, mean, sd) It is simply verified that \\(X\\) indeed seems to follow a univariate normal distribution by asking for some summary statistics. summary(X) ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## -3.37174 -0.67546 -0.01313 -0.02582 0.66400 3.49530 Additionally, we can plot the histogram of the variable \\(X\\) to assess its shape. library(tidyverse) library(ggthemes) ggplot(mapping = aes(x = X)) + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..)) + stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = mean, sd = sd)) + theme_minimal() "]]
